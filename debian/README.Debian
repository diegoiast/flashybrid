If you want to enable this package you only have to do three steps:

1) create the directory /ram
2) modify the value ENABLED in /etc/default/flashybrid
3) reboot

Step 3 is mandatory, because the init.d script modifies the FSH before most
of the processes start running. 

To modify any configuration, you need only to modify the configuration files, 
and reboot.Currently there is no alternative, since I have not found a way 
moving the open file handles from one file system (the tmpfs) into another 
(your real flash, HD). 


If you want to remove this package, you should first disable it,
boot the machine, and ONLY WHEN THE MACHINE HAS BEEN REBOOTED WITHOUT FLASHYBRID
RUNNING YOU CAN REMOVE THE PACKAGE ITSELF. If you do not to do it this way,
you can potentially loose data (things like configuration files in /etc/ will 
not get synced to the real drive, stay only in the tmpfs and lost on reboot.

You cannot restart this "service", since some file descriptors may open on the
tmpfs. The reload and restart actions are NULL, and I only put them to keep 
lintain happy about LSB.
