flashybrid (0.12) experimental; urgency=low

  * New maintainer + new uploader
  * Merge changes done in Xorcom Rapid distribution into Debian (Closes: #352932)
  * /etc/default/flashybrid:
    - Added option to remove verbosity level 
    - Added option option to specify maximum amount of memory to use
    - Modified configuration to match Sarge and Etch software.
  * Removed the full configuration and embedded configuration.
  * Only ramtmp and ramdisk are supported right now, all other configurations
    are obsolete.
  * init.d script checks for ability of RAMMOUNT directory before starting.
  * RAMSTORAGE configuration is stored on the ramdrive, which means you can 
    modify the configuration, without messing your box. The new config will be
    applied on the next reboot
  * Added a debconf warning, as this package can break systems if not handled
    carefully,

flashybrid (0.002) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add GPL to source package.
  * Add When section to README.
  * Lots of updates to docs.
  * I am not longer using partial directories, so that part of flashybrid
    is now marked as unsupported. I will take patches though, and it was very
    useful for a year, so I left it in.
  * Split fh into fh-full and fh-embed.
  * Add diskstore support.
  * Make DISKMOUNT optional.
  * Add an /etc/default file that controls whether the init script is
    enabled. Ship with it disabled to avoid hosing systems.
  * Use more bind mounts, and less modification of the root filesystem.
  * Make init script better about not doubling mounts when re-started,
    and make it unmount the ram disk on stop.
  * Supports /dev in a ramdisk for non-devfs system support.
  * Move RAMTMP to ramtmp file.
  * Add man pages.
  * Add --delete to rsync call, delete old files on shutdown sync.
