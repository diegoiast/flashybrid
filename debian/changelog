flashybrid (0.002) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add GPL to source package.
  * Add When section to README.
  * Lots of updates to docs.
  * I am not longer using partial directories, so that part of flashybrid
    is now marked as unsupported. I will take patches though, and it was very
    useful for a year, so I left it in.
  * Split fh into fh-full and fh-embed.
  * Add diskstore support.
  * Make DISKMOUNT optional.
  * Add an /etc/default file that controls whether the init script is
    enabled. Ship with it disabled to avoid hosing systems.
  * Use more bind mounts, and less modification of the root filesystem.
  * Make init script better about not doubling mounts when re-started,
    and make it unmount the ram disk on stop.
  * Supports /dev in a ramdisk for non-devfs system support.
  * Move RAMTMP to ramtmp file.
  * Add man pages.
  * Add --delete to rsync call, delete old files on shutdown sync.
