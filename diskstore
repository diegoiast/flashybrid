# This is a list of directories that are stored on a hard disk instead of
# on the flash. When the system is in full mode the directories on the disk
# will be bind mounted into the root filesystem.
#
# If you want to keep some files from a directory on flash and others on
# disk, you can edit the partial file instead.

# The easiest thing to move to a disk is documentation, so you should start
# here:
#/usr/share/doc
#/usr/share/man
#/usr/share/info

# Other candidates for disk, in approximate order of difficulty to move
# them to disk:
#/usr/share/locale
#/usr/X11R6
#/root
#/var/cache/apt
#/var/lib/apt
#/var/lib/dpkg
#/usr/share
#/usr/lib

# Note that if you choose to move all of /usr to disk, you should take care
# to not also list directories under /usr as that would confuse flashybrid.
#/usr
