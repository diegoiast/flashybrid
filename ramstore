# This is a list of directories that are used to store variable data
# that is written to during normal operation of the system, and that should
# be preserved across reboots.
#
# On boot, the listed directories on your flash disk will be copied to the
# ram disk, and then bind mounts will be used to make the directories on
# the ram disk replace them.
#
# On shutdown, the contents of those directories on the ramdisk will be
# rsynced back to the flash disk.
#
# Directories listed here that are not present will be silently ignored. 
# Do not put the trailing slash on directories!

# Should always be in ram disk.
