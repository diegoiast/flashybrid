# Partial directory copy config file for flashybrid.
#
# WARNING: This may still work, but the author no longer uses it on his
#          systems and so it is largely untested and unsupported.
#
# This file which helps you set up and manage directories on a flash disk
# (or other small medium) that contain subsets of directories on a hard 
# disk. Use it for directories like /usr/bin, that have a lot of extraneous
# files, and a few files that your system really needs in embedded mode. Do
# _not_ use it for directories like /var/lib, which have lots of
# subdirectories which often change and others that are static.
# 
# Simply list all the files that you want to have on the flash disk. You
# can use wildcards too.
#
# fh-update will look at the listed files and set up .partial
# directories that contain them (for example, /usr/bin.partial). The fh
# program will then use bind mounts to arrange for the full directory from
# the disk to be mounted there when the disk is mounted, and the partial
# directory is mounted there when the disk is unmounted.
# 
# It is not a good idea to put libraries in here.
