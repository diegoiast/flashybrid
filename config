# You probably want a ramdisk to be set up with directories that the system
# needs to write data to frequently, so that your flash disk can be mounted
# read-only. Flash memory can only be written to several thousand times over
# its lifetime, so setting up a ramdisk will extend the lifetime of your
# flash a lot. This is the location to mount the ramdisk. Comment out the
# line to not set up a ram disk.
RAMMOUNT=/ram

# You can use a hard drive in combination with your flash disk, to hold
# parts of the system that won't fit in flash. If you have such a disk,
# this controls where it will be mounted, and /etc/fstab should be set up
# to allow mounting of the disk to this directory. If you have no disk,
# comment it out.
#DISKMOUNT=/disk

# Commands to run to enter full mode. The disk will be mounted before
# this.
FULL_CMDS="mount -o remount,rw /"

# Commands to run to enter embedded mode. The disk will be unmounted before
# this. If you wanted to spin a disk down, you could add a hdparm -y
# command.
EMBED_CMDS="mount -o remount,ro /"

# You may also want to edit the other files in this directory:
# ramtmp, ramstore, diskstore, and partial
