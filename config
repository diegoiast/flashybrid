# You probably want a ramdisk to be set up with directories that the system
# needs to write data to frequently, so that your flash disk can be mounted
# read-only. Flash memory can only be written to several thousand times over
# its lifetime, so setting up a ramdisk will extend the lifetime of your
# flash a lot. This is the location to mount the ramdisk. Comment out the
# line to not set up a ram disk.

# Commands to run to enter full mode. The disk will be mounted before
# this.

# Commands to run to enter embedded mode. The disk will be unmounted before
# this. If you wanted to spin a disk down, you could add a hdparm -y
# command.
EMBED_CMDS="mount -o remount,ro /"

# This controls the maximum ammount of memory you want to allocate  
# to the tmpfs RAM drive
# This parameter is optional, and if you do not supply if, tmpfs will
# occupy up to 50% of your available memory (ram+swap)
