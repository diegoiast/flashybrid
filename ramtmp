# This is a list of directories that should be set up as temporary
# directories in the ramdisk. On boot, the directories listed will be
# created on the ramdisk, mode 1777. Their contents will not be saved
# across reboots. The equivilent directories on your flash will be
# removed and replaced with symlinks to these directories.

# Do not put the trailing slash on directories!
